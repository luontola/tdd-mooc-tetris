# Level 0: Think

Always start by thinking about the problem:

1. Find a game of Tetris and play it for a few minutes. Searching the web for `tetris online` should
   find [Free Tetris](https://www.freetetris.org/) and numerous other Tetris implementations.

2. Think about what requirements and game rules Tetris has.

3. Think about what kind of design could be used to satisfy those requirements.

After you have spent at least 15 minutes thinking about the problem, you should have a rough guess that how to implement
the game. _The guess will likely be wrong_, because you will never again know as little about Tetris as now.

Next when you'll start implementing Tetris, hold back from implementing more of your design than is necessary to make
the currently failing test pass, while at the same time not blocking progress toward your current understanding of an
ideal design. Always keep an open mind and look for indicators that your current design doesn't fit the problem well,
and then start refactoring toward a more suitable design.
