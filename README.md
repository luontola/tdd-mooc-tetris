# TDD MOOC: Tetris Exercise

In this exercise you will be implementing a Tetris game using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The first couple dozen
tests have already been written for you - just uncomment them one by one. This should help to get over the initial
hurdle of knowing what tests to write when getting started with TDD. After that the training wheels are removed, and
it's time to write your own tests in the latter part of this exercise.

This exercise uses [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (ES6/ECMAScript 2015),
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
assertions, but the concepts are language agnostic. It would be quite easy to translate the example tests to another
programming language as you go.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version. Then download this project's dependencies with:

    npm install

## Developing

Run tests once

    npm run test

Run tests continuously

    npm run autotest

Code reformat

    npm run format
